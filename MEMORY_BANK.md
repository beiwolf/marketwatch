### 2026-03-05 — `9410395`
**Message:** `feature: summary audit log + highlight timestamps`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`

**What changed:**

**Summary Audit Log:**
- Added `summaryHistory[]` array (max 8 entries, newest-first) and `_lastSummaryText`/`_lastSummaryTime` tracking vars
- Each time `renderNews` fires with a changed summary, the old summary is archived to `summaryHistory` with its `last_updated` timestamp
- Rendered as a `<details class="summary-history">` accordion below the current summary — collapsed by default, labeled "Previous summaries (N)" with a rotating ▶ arrow
- CSS: `.summary-history`, `.summary-history-toggle`, `.sh-toggle-arrow`, `.summary-history-entries`, `.summary-hist-item`, `.shi-time`, `.shi-text`

**Highlight Timestamps:**
- Each highlight item now shows `added_at` from the matching source (cross-referenced by `source_url → sources[].added_at`)
- Rendered as `.hi-time` (small muted mono) in the `.hi-meta` row, between the source badge and headline
- Only shown when a matching source with `added_at` exists

### 2026-03-05 — `eee0461`
**Message:** `feat: market clock, sector watchlist, push alerts`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`

**What changed:**
Three new features:

1. **Market hours countdown** — New chip in topbar (`#chip-clock`). Uses `America/New_York` timezone. States: "Open · Xh Ym left" (green), "Pre-market · Opens in Xh Ym" (amber), "After Hours · Closed" (dim), "Weekend · Closed" (dim). Updates every 30s.

2. **Sector watchlist** — "My Watchlist" card at top of news column. Users click "+ Add Sector" to open a dropdown picker of available sectors. Pinned sectors show as mini-cards with live name, ETF, and % change. Remove with ✕. Stored in `localStorage` key `mw_watchlist`. Updated on every `renderFlow` call via `latestSectors` array.

3. **Push notifications** — 🔔 bell button in topbar. Click to request browser `Notification` permission. When enabled (green highlight), fires alerts for: regime/market mode flips, any sector moving ≥2% between polls, SPY crossing zero, and new breaking news. State persisted in `localStorage` key `mw_notif`. Breaking news tracked by `mw_last_break` key to avoid duplicates.

**CSS additions:** `.chip-clock/.mkt-open/.mkt-closed/.mkt-pre`, `.wl-card/.wl-empty/.wl-grid/.wl-item/.wl-name/.wl-etf/.wl-pct/.wl-remove/.wl-add-btn/.wl-picker/.wl-picker-item`, `.notif-btn/.notif-on`

**JS additions:** `updateMarketClock()`, `saveWatchlist()`, `renderWatchlist()`, `toggleWatchlistPicker()`, `addToWatchlist()`, `removeFromWatchlist()`, `updateNotifBtn()`, `toggleNotifications()`, `sendNotif()`, `checkAlerts()`. Globals: `watchlist`, `latestSectors`, `notifEnabled`, `prevFlowData`.

### 2026-03-05 — `f0a19a4`
**Message:** `ux: simplify jargon for basic investors — plain English labels`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`

**What changed:**
Replaced finance jargon with plain English labels to make the dashboard accessible to basic investors:
- "Net Flow Score" → "Market Flow" (card title + hero label)
- "Breadth" → "Sectors Up / Down"
- "% Advancing" → "% Green"
- "Avg Sector" → "Avg Move"
- "Sector Rotation" → "Sectors" + legend: "⚡ Unusual volume · ~ Estimated · ▲▼ Change"
- "◀ Outflow / Inflow ▶" → "◀ Money Out / Money In ▶"
- "Inflows / Outflows" → "Winners / Losers"
- "Net Flow Trend" → "Market Flow — 10 Days"
- "Regime changed" → "Market mode changed" (flip banner)
- "Regime" → "Mode" (timeline label)
- "Mood" → "Sentiment" (arc label)
- Sentiment ratio: `5↑ 2↓ 3→` → `5 Bullish 2 Bearish 3 Neutral`
- "Intraday net flow" → "Today's market flow" (sparkline label)

### 2026-03-05 — `b30e4c1`
**Message:** `feat: 13 new features — charts, heatmap, mood arc, regime alerts, minimap + more`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`
- `sw.js` (created)

**What changed:**
All 13 features added in one comprehensive update:

1. **Multi-day net flow trend chart** — SVG line chart in "Net Flow Trend" card showing last 10 days of `net_close` from `flow_index.json`. Colored dots per day (green/red), zero-line, date labels.
2. **Sector heatmap** — New card in flow col. 4-column CSS grid of all sectors; background color intensity scales with magnitude relative to max, hue by direction (green/red).
3. **Flow regime timeline** — Appears inside each audit day block when regime transitions occurred. Compresses consecutive same-regime snapshots into pill trail with arrows between changes.
4. **Intraday mood arc** — Row of 8px colored dots (one per snapshot) inside audit day block; green=risk-on, red=risk-off, amber=neutral. Only shown if ≥2 snapshots have mood data.
5. **Sentiment ratio badge** — `5↑ 2↓ 3→` pill row in Key Highlights card header, populated on each `renderNews` call.
6. **Top Mover Spotlight card** — Dedicated card at top of right column. Shows top_mover name (large mono), % change, ETF badge, reason text. Populated from `renderFlow`.
7. **Regime flip alert** — Amber banner below topbar on page load when `flow_regime` differs from last known value. Persists across polls. Dismissable with ✕ button.
8. **Stale data warning** — `chip-updated` turns amber (`chip-amber`) if `generated_at` is >20 min old and current time is within market hours (9:30–16:30). Shows tooltip with age.
9. **URL hash deep-linking** — `#YYYY-MM-DD` in URL scrolls to matching `.audit-day-block` on load and on `hashchange`. Clicking any day header updates hash via `history.replaceState`.
10. **Jump to Today floating button** — Fixed bottom-right button (`↑ Today`). Appears when audit section is scrolled >60px above viewport. Scrolls to today's block and updates hash.
11. **Keyboard navigation** — Global `j`/`k` moves between `.audit-entry` elements (blue outline highlight), `Enter` toggles open/closed. Ignores when focused on form elements.
12. **Service worker / offline cache** — `sw.js` registered at `./sw.js`. Network-first strategy for `/data/` files (caches fresh responses, falls back to cache). Cache-first for shell. Cleans stale caches on activate.
13. **Minimap sidebar** — Fixed right-side panel (hidden `<1460px`). One colored bar per audit day; `IntersectionObserver` highlights the currently-visible day. Bars link to `#YYYY-MM-DD` hashes. Updated after `loadAllAudit` resolves.

**CSS additions:** `.hm-wrap/.hm-grid/.hm-cell/.hm-etf/.hm-name/.hm-pct`, `.trend-chart-wrap/.tc-svg`, `.mood-arc/.mood-arc-dots/.ma-dot`, `.regime-timeline/.rt-label/.rt-pills/.rt-pill/.rt-on/.rt-off/.rt-neu/.rt-arrow`, `.sent-ratio/.sr-bull/.sr-bear/.sr-neu`, `.spotlight-wrap/.spotlight-ticker/.spotlight-pct/.spotlight-reason`, `.regime-flip-banner/.rfb-icon/.rfb-text/.rfb-close`, `.jump-today-btn`, `.minimap/.mm-entry/.mm-label/.mm-bar/.mm-active`, `.audit-entry.kb-active`, `.audit-kb-hint`

**JS additions:** `checkRegimeFlip()`, `checkStaleData()`, `renderSectorHeatmap()`, `renderSentimentRatio()`, `buildMoodArc()`, `buildRegimeTimeline()`, `renderTrendChart()`, `jumpToToday()`, `initJumpToday()`, `initKeyboardNav()`, `updateMinimap()`, `updateMinimapActive()`, `scrollToHash()`. `auditDataCache` global object caches snapshots for minimap use.

### 2026-03-05 — `ff78889`
**Message:** `ux: show industry name + ETF ticker in audit sector cells`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`

**What changed:**
- Audit snapshot sector cells previously only showed the ETF code (XLE, XLK, etc.) with no sector context.
- Each cell now shows the sector/industry name (`s.name`, e.g. "Technology") as the primary label, with the ETF ticker below it as a secondary tag.
- CSS: replaced `.asc-name` with `.asc-info` (flex column), `.asc-industry` (12px 500-weight text), `.asc-etf` (10px mono muted), `.asc-pct` (13px bold mono, right-aligned).
- JS: `buildAuditEntries` cell template updated to render both `s.name` and `s.etf`, with `s.name || s.etf` fallback.

### 2026-03-05 — `e6947cb`
**Message:** `ux: continuous-scroll flow audit — all days, inter/intra-day dividers`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`

**What changed:**
- Removed date picker UI (Today button + past-dates `<select>`) from audit section header.
- Replaced single-date audit view with a full continuous scroll of all available days.
- New `loadAllAudit(indexData)` fetches all archive dates in parallel on first page load, renders newest-first.
- New `refreshTodayBlock()` called on every 60s poll — only re-fetches today's archive, not the full history.
- `auditInitialized` flag prevents re-running full load on subsequent polls.
- Removed JS functions: `loadAuditForDate`, `switchToToday`, `populateDatePicker`.
- Each day is a `.audit-day-block` containing:
  - **Inter-day header** (`.audit-day-header`): bold 4px left accent bar (green/red by closing net), 28px mono closing score, date + day-of-week label, snapshot count, status pill (Live / Finalized / Partial).
  - **Intra-day entries** (`.audit-day-entries`): existing `<details>` accordion rows, indented with a 2px left timeline rail whose color matches the day's direction.
- New CSS classes: `.audit-day-block`, `.audit-day-header`, `.audit-day-datecol`, `.audit-day-date`, `.audit-day-dow`, `.audit-day-close`, `.audit-day-info`, `.audit-day-meta`, `.audit-day-status` (.live / .final / .partial), `.audit-day-entries`.
- Removed CSS: `.date-picker-wrap`, `.date-picker-label`, `.date-btn`, `#date-select`, `.audit-day-label`.

**Message:** `sched+ui: launchd scheduler, flow history panel, compact news list`

**Files changed:**
- `index.html`
- `scripts/install_launchd_scheduler.sh`

**What changed:**
- Added launchd installer script for a real persistent scheduler service:

  - runs `automation.sh` at login and keeps it alive.
- Updated dashboard with second-tier FLOW history/pattern section (recent-day table from `flow_index.json`).
- Condensed NEWS rendering by capping visible highlights to latest 12 and constraining list height (`highlights-list`), preventing page from growing monolithically.

## Operational notes (today)
- Scheduler is a background process (`automation.sh`), not system cron.
- Flow parser was hardened to extract JSON even when Claude wraps it with prose/fences.
- News loop was changed to run every 60 minutes 24/7 (flow remains market-hours-gated).
- Telegram status notifications were integrated into loop outcomes (success/failure summaries).

## Working rules (requested by owner)
- Before making any repository change, consult `MEMORY_BANK.md` first for current context.
- After every change that gets pushed to GitHub, immediately append/update this memory bank with:
  - commit hash
  - files changed
  - what changed and why

---

## How to refresh this memory bank
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/marketwatch
git log --oneline --decorate --max-count=50
```
Then update this file with commit purpose + changed files.
